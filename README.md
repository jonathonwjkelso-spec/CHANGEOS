# ChangeOS

**Continuous change sensing. Read situations. Shift trajectories.**

ChangeOS is a change intelligence platform that helps practitioners see what's actually happening in their change initiatives — not what the status reports say.

---

## What it does

One workspace. One living artefact: the **Situation Read**.

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **What's happening** | Observable signals with confidence levels |
| **What it means** | Pattern interpretation |
| **What it needs** | Structural, Relational, and Presence responses |
| **What we'll do** | Committed actions with timing |
| **What we're unsure about** | Explicit unknowns |

Every claim links to evidence. Uncertainty is shown, not hidden.

---

## The philosophy

Traditional change management tracks activities while initiatives fail. ChangeOS is different:

- **Situation-first** — No forcing reality into framework stages
- **Evidence-bound** — Insights anchored in observed signals
- **Trajectory-oriented** — Where is this heading, not where are we in the model

The goal isn't explanation. It's shifted trajectories.
