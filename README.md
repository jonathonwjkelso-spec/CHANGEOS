# ChangeOS

**Change Intelligence Platform**

Read situations. Shift trajectories.

## What is ChangeOS?

ChangeOS is a prototype change intelligence platform that helps practitioners see what's actually happening in change initiatives — and what's coming next.

Unlike traditional change management tools that track activities (training completion, comms sent), ChangeOS provides continuous sensing and prediction through analytical lenses.

## Core Concepts

**The Constitution**
1. **Situation-First** — Never force reality into predefined stage models
2. **Evidence-Bound** — Insights anchored in observed signals, uncertainty explicit
3. **Trajectory-Oriented** — The goal is shifted trajectories, not explanation

**The Situation Read**
The primary output — a living read (not a periodic report) that answers:
- What's Happening (signals)
- What It Means (patterns)
- What It Needs (response)
- What We'll Do (interventions)
- What We're Unsure About (uncertainties)

**Response Philosophy**
- 🔧 Structural — constraints, capacity, systems
- 💬 Relational — trust, identity, conflict
- 👁 Presence — attention, visibility, meaning-making

## Demo

The live demo uses synthetic data from "Project Horizon" — a finance system migration at a fictional regional council. It demonstrates how ChangeOS surfaces risks that traditional tracking misses.

## Technology

- React 18 + Vite
