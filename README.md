## What is ChangeOS?

ChangeOS analyses change initiative data through predictive lenses to surface risks before they become failures. Unlike traditional change management tools that track activities, ChangeOS provides continuous sensing and prediction.

### Features

- **Predictive Risk Analysis** — Adoption Cliff, Attrition Risk, and Technical Debt predictions
- **Signal Cluster Mapping** — Training effectiveness, manager readiness, resistance patterns, support infrastructure, and leadership engagement
- **Say/Do Gap Detection** — Surface the delta between official narrative and ground truth
- **Intervention Window Tracking** — Know when you still have time to act
- **Trajectory Visualisation** — See how risks evolved over time

### Demo Mode

The app includes pre-loaded data from "Project Horizon" — a synthetic finance system migration case study demonstrating the platform's analytical capabilities.
