**Change Intelligence Platform**

Read situations. Shift trajectories.

## What is ChangeOS?

ChangeOS is a **Change Intelligence** platform — the capability to continuously interpret change signals into actionable responses, with explicit evidence and acknowledged uncertainty.

It enables practitioners to:
- **Sense** what's actually happening across an initiative
- **Interpret** patterns through multiple analytical lenses
- **Respond** to what situations specifically need
- **Track** trajectories as they evolve over time

---

## The Constitution

Three principles govern ChangeOS:

1. **Situation-First** — Every initiative is unique. ChangeOS reads what THIS situation is showing, adapting to context rather than forcing fit.

2. **Evidence-Bound** — Insights are anchored in observed signals. Uncertainty is explicit. When signals conflict, the tension is shown.

3. **Trajectory-Oriented** — The focus is direction and velocity. Where is this heading? What's the intervention window? How do we shift the trajectory?

## The Situation Read

The primary output is the **Situation Read** — a living synthesis that answers five questions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SITUATION READ                       │

│  Completion metrics are masking readiness gaps.         │
│  This is a socio-technical cascade, not isolated issues.│

│  🔧 STRUCTURAL: Finance capacity relief                 │
│  💬 RELATIONAL: Angela needs listening, not convincing  │

│  WHAT WE'RE UNSURE ABOUT (Uncertainties)                │
│  • Is Angela's withdrawal temporary or exit?            │
│  • Will sponsor respond or delegate again?              │

## The Lens Framework

ChangeOS processes signals through multiple analytical **lenses** — each detecting specific patterns and generating specific insights.

### Sensing Lenses
*What's actually happening*

| Lens | What It Detects |
|------|-----------------|
| **Sentiment Trajectory** | Direction and velocity of confidence — building or eroding? |
| **Say/Do Gap** | Delta between official narrative and ground truth |
| **Resistance Topology** | Who's resistant, why, and what they're sensing |
| **Network Stress** | Where people actually go for support |
| **Signal Strength** | Reliability of inputs — silence as data |

### Diagnostic Lenses
*What it means*

| Lens | What It Interprets |
|------|-------------------|
| **Readiness vs Rhetoric** | Gap between stated and actual readiness |
| **Risk Honesty** | Delta between registered and actual risks |
| **Leadership Visibility** | Sponsor engagement patterns over time |
| **Capacity Reality** | Stated vs actual resource load |

### Predictive Lenses
*What's coming*

| Lens | What It Anticipates |
|------|---------------------|
| **Adoption Cliff** | Go-live/adoption failure probability |
| **Attrition Risk** | Departure likelihood for key people and teams |
| **Technical Debt** | Workarounds forming that will calcify |

---

## Trajectories

ChangeOS tracks trajectories across dimensions that matter:

| Trajectory | What It Tracks |
|------------|----------------|
| **Trust** | Is confidence building or eroding? Among whom? How fast? |
| **Capacity** | Is workload sustainable? What's the trend? |
| **Adoption** | Are people moving toward the change or away? |
| **Workarounds** | Are shadow systems forming? Will they calcify? |
| **Sponsor Presence** | Is leadership engagement increasing or fading? |
| **Support Load** | Is the support model keeping pace with demand? |

Each trajectory shows:
- **Direction** — improving / stable / declining
- **Velocity** — rate of change
- **Intervention window** — time remaining before options narrow

---

## Response Philosophy

ChangeOS frames responses in three categories:

### 🔧 Structural
Constraints, capacity, systems, decision rights, incentives. What conditions need to change?

### 💬 Relational
Trust, identity, legitimacy, conflict, coalition dynamics. What human dynamics need attention?

### 👁 Presence
Leadership attention, witnessing, meaning-making. Where is visibility itself the intervention?

---

## Signal Input Templates

ChangeOS provides structured templates for capturing change signals:

### Surveys & Pulse Checks
- **Readiness Pulse** — Quick confidence/preparedness check
- **Manager Cascade Check** — Are managers equipped to support?
- **Post-Training Effectiveness** — Completion vs competence vs confidence
- **Go-Live Readiness** — Multi-dimension readiness assessment
- **Team Health Pulse** — Burnout, support, workload indicators

### Meeting & Conversation Capture
- **Steering Committee Notes** — Decisions, concerns raised, actions
- **Team Briefing Notes** — Questions asked, themes, energy
- **1:1 Conversation Summary** — Key concerns, commitments, follow-ups
- **Informal Observation** — Corridor conversations, mood, behaviours

### Risk & Issue Tracking
- **Risk Register Entry** — Rating, trajectory, mitigation effectiveness
- **Issue Log** — Impact, workarounds emerging, resolution status
- **Escalation Record** — What was escalated, response, outcome

### Support & Adoption Signals
- **Help Desk Analysis** — Volume, themes, resolution patterns
- **Training Feedback** — Session effectiveness, gaps identified
- **Workaround Detection** — Shadow processes emerging

## Demo: Project Horizon

The live demo uses synthetic data from **Project Horizon** — a finance system migration at Coastal Regional Council.

**Context:**
- 850 staff organisation, 600 affected
- 12-week implementation
- Finance team (35 people) most intensively impacted

**The dataset includes:**
- Meeting transcripts across 12 weeks
- Three survey waves with open comments
- Risk register with status evolution
- Informal observations and corridor conversations
- Support ticket patterns
- Outcome data (what actually happened)

The demo shows how ChangeOS surfaces patterns and trajectories from this signal data.
